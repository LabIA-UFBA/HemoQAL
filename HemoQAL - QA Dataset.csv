What role does plasmin play in the degradation of von Willebrand factor (VWF)?,"Plasmin is a non-specific protease that, besides fibrin, also cleaves fibrinogen and VWF [25]. The conversion of plasminogen to plasmin is mediated by tissue- (t-PA) or urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA). Binding to fibrin dramatically increases t-PA-, but not u-PA-mediated plasminogen activation [26, 27]. While t-PA is the principal activator of intravascular fibrinolysis, u-PA is predominantly involved in extracellular proteolysis relevant to cell migration and tissue remodeling. Importantly, u-PA expression may be upregulated in cancer cells [28, 29]. In this regard, it is noteworthy that we also measured increased plasma levels of u-PA (1178, 1589, and 1642 pg/mL) in the same three plasma samples that were used for analysis of PAP complexes (Fig. 3c, Table 2). In comparison, u-PA plasma levels were 280–413 pg/mL in patients 1, 2, and 6. Excessive activation of the fibrinolytic system through overexpression of u-PA has been observed in patients with AL amyloidosis, but not in those with MM [30]. It is tempting to speculate that aberrant expression of u-PA by bone marrow plasma cells contributed to AVWS in our patient by promoting plasmin-mediated VWF degradation.",Plasmin is a non-specific protease that cleaves fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor (VWF). The conversion of plasminogen to plasmin is mediated by tissue- (t-PA) or urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA).

What are the two most common genetic polymorphisms known to increase the risks of thromboembolism?,"For example, it would be very important to better explain the mortality rate of this virus, to genotype all subjects who died from COVID-19 for factor V Leiden (FVL) and prothrombin G20210A mutation (PTM), which are considered the two most common genetic polymorphisms known to increase the risks of thromboembolism [56–60].",Factor V Leiden (FVL) and prothrombin G20210A mutation (PTM)
What are the common symptoms that should lead to a suspicion of hemophilia?,"Hemophilia should be suspected in patients with history of easy bruising in early childhood, spontaneous bleeding in joints and soft tissues, excessive bleeding during trauma or surgery, and family history of bleeding.","Easy bruising in early childhood, spontaneous bleeding in joints and soft tissues, excessive bleeding during trauma or surgery, and family history of bleeding."
What is a potential consequence of exposure to rpFVIII in patients with FVIII inhibitors?,"RpFVIII was safe and initially effective in achieving haemostasis in all patients with FVIII inhibitors. However, all five patients developed evidence of resistance to rpFVIII after exposure, with decreased efficacy of the drug in association and with detectable porcine FVIII inhibitors. Further, three out five patients developed elevations in the anti-hFVIII titres after exposure to rpFVIII.","A potential consequence of exposure to rpFVIII in patients with FVIII inhibitors is the development of resistance to rpFVIII, with decreased efficacy of the drug and detectable porcine FVIII inhibitors, as well as elevations in the anti-hFVIII titres."
What is one potential reason for the negative impact of the bleeding disorder on the lives of PWBD?,"This finding might be due to a low proportion of patients receiving prophylactic factor replacement therapy, emphasising the need for implementation of early and continuous prophylaxis.",A low proportion of patients receiving prophylactic factor replacement therapy.
What is the significance of the JAK2 mutation in ET patients?,"We have confirmed that the occurrence of JAK2 mutation can be a strong predictor for thromboembolic events in ET patients. Seventeen out of 21 ET patients with thrombotic complications were JAK2 (+). Since its discovery in 2005, the JAK2 mutation has been considered as an important participant in the development of thrombotic complications in Ph-myeloproliferative neoplasms, but the agreement was not universal.1 Carobbio et al. in 657 studied ET patients did not find a significant association for JAK2 mutation and the frequency of thromboembolic events.7 De Stefano et al. confirmed that in JAK2 (+) ET patients aged < 60 years the risk of thrombosis increased 3.8 fold in the presence of homozygous and 2.2 fold in the case of a hetrozygous type of FV Leiden mutation.8 The systematic review and meta-analysis of 2,436 patients with ET shows that JAK2 positivity correlated with a clear increase in the odds of thrombosis (OR = 1.83)9, and this was also observed by others.10–12 Our findings are in line with the results of Schwartz et al.,13 who have proven, on the basis of an analyzed cohort of 1,179 thrombocythemic Ph-myeloptroliferations, that JAK2 mutation affected significantly the incidence of thrombosis (both arterial and venous). The JAK2 mutation has been included recently into the major criteria for ET14,15, and is also considered as a major prothrombotic risk factor in the International Prognostic Score in Essential Thrombocythemia (IPSET) risk factor study in WHO-defined ET.16",The JAK2 mutation is a strong predictor for thromboembolic events in ET patients and is considered an important participant in the development of thrombotic complications in Ph-myeloproliferative neoplasms.

What must be explored and assessed further in HEHE after LT?,"Recurrence after LT in HEHE must be explored and assessed further. Survival rates at more than 10 years must also be documented and reported in the literature, as recurrence is an unpredictable event after LT.",Recurrence after LT in HEHE must be explored and assessed further.
What is the recommended blood sampling time for patients with FVIII:C at T1<0.30 IU/mL or FVIII:C≥0.80 IU/mL?,"As a standardised desmopressin test regimen for the individual haemophilia A patient, we suggest blood sampling solely at T0 and T1 in patients with FVIII:C at T1<0.30 IU/mL (non-responder) or FVIII:C≥0.80 IU/mL (sustained responder).",The recommended blood sampling time for patients with FVIII:C at T1<0.30 IU/mL or FVIII:C≥0.80 IU/mL is solely at T0 and T1.
What is the standard of care for patients with haemophilia B?,"The standard of care for patients with haemophilia B is individualized, life-long FIX replacement therapy (Sect. 1), which is used on-demand to treat and control bleeding episodes, perioperatively to manage bleeding associated with minor and major surgery and, when indicated, as routine prophylaxis to reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes [1–3, 6, 7].","The standard of care for patients with haemophilia B is individualized, life-long FIX replacement therapy, which is used on-demand to treat and control bleeding episodes, perioperatively to manage bleeding associated with minor and major surgery and, when indicated, as routine prophylaxis to reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes."
What is the relationship between hemophilic condition and vascular permeability?,"The increased vascular permeability in the hemophilic condition appears to be responsible for the increased accumulation of rhFVIIa observed in knee joints of hemophilia mice compared with wild-type mice. Although there were no detailed studies on how the hemophilic condition affects permeability under basal conditions, measurement of capillary permeability using human 99Tc-albumin showed an enhanced capillary permeability in hemophilia patients over control subjects. An increased permeability at the lung bases was also found in human immunodeficiency virus positive hemophilia patients compared with normal individuals.","The hemophilic condition is associated with increased vascular permeability, which is responsible for the increased accumulation of rhFVIIa in knee joints of hemophilia mice compared with wild-type mice.

What role do HLA class II molecules play in the immune response related to FVIII inhibitor development?,"Classical immune response to an external antigen is believed to be the mechanism of FVIII inhibitor development. The immune response is typically started with the internalization of replaced FVIII via antigen-presenting cells and CD4-positive T cells. Activated CD4-positive T cells subsequently activate FVIII-specific B cells, and these proliferate and differentiate into plasmocytes or FVIII-specific memory B cells. During this process, HLA class II molecules play an important role in the presentation of FVIII peptides to the CD4-positive T cell.",HLA class II molecules play an important role in the presentation of FVIII peptides to the CD4-positive T cell.
