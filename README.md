# HemoQAL: Building and Assessing a Hemophilia Q&amp;A Dataset for Advancing Domain-Specific Language Models

Thank you for your interesting in using our HemoQAL dataset! The effective use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating coherent and informative content in specialized domains has largely been driven by the development of robust evaluation strategies. Based on this assumption, we introduce HemoQAL, a question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) dataset on hemophilia, derived from recent scientific publications and clinical guidelines. Our main contribution lies in conventional and human-centered evaluation approaches to assess the quality of LLM-generated content. First, we carried out a human evaluation in which medical experts assessed the factual accuracy and educational value of the generated Q&amp;A pairs. Second, we conducted a semantic similarity analysis to quantitatively evaluate the alignment between each Q&amp;A pair and its original source material. These lightweight, scalable semantic metrics offer an efficient alternative to more resource-intensive human or LLM-based evaluation pipelines. Our findings show that integrating expert review with semantic similarity measures improves the reliability and trustworthiness of LLM-generated medical content, contributing to the development of dependable AI tools in health informatics.

Since our work aims to assess the reliability and contextual alignment of Q\&amp;A generated by a general-purpose LLM in the hemophilia domain, we address the challenge of evaluating the consistency and relevance of the generated content. To do this, we first created a specialized Q&amp;A dataset based on hemophilia-related texts, followed by two complementary experiments:

- content validation through a Human Judgment Analysis to ensure quality and educational value;
- semantic similarity analysis by leveraging TF-IDF for keyword overlap, Word2Vec for basic semantic relationships, and BERT for deep contextual understanding.
